This pipeline converts seekdeep output files generated by
Nick Hathaway's seekdeep program into VCF files and amino
acid tables suitable for easy graphing, e.g. with
github.com/simkin-bioinformatics/AA_table_visualization.
The pipeline assumes that you have snakemake, singularity,
and Nick's elucidator.sif file already installed on your
system. Example inputs are provided in the yaml file.
